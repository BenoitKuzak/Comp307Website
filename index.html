        Give similar suggestions to the movies and video games that you have enjoyed in the past and may also enjoy in the future. <br>
        <p>The suggestion process is crowd-sourced, as in users put the other titles that they feel are similar
            to a certain movie or video game. Then we would compile the data and present similar titles to a movie or video game
            based on how consistently people feel those titles are similar.</p>
